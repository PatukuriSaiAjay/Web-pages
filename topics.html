		<h1>INTERNET OF THINGS:</h1>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="-blank">Internet of things</a> (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.The Internet of things encompasses electronics, communication, and computer science engineering. "Internet of things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.<br>
    		The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, and increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning.[9] Older fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with "smart home" products, including devices and appliances (lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.

    	<h1>SOFTWARE TESTING:</h1>
  		<p>
    		<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/" target="-blank">Software testing</a> is an important process in the software development lifecycle. It involves verifying and validating that a software application is free of bugs, meets the technical requirements set by its design and development, and satisfies user requirements efficiently and effectively.<br>
			This process ensures that the application can handle all exceptional and boundary cases, providing a robust and reliable user experience. By systematically identifying and fixing issues, software testing helps deliver high-quality software that performs as expected in various scenarios.<br>

		<h1>COMPUTER NETWORKS:</h1>
		<p>
			A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">computer network</a> is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.<br>

			The nodes of a computer network can include personal computers, servers, networking hardware, or other specialized or general-purpose hosts. They are identified by network addresses and may have hostnames. Hostnames serve as memorable labels for the nodes and are rarely changed after initial assignment. Network addresses serve for locating and identifying the nodes by communication protocols such as the Internet Protocol.<br>

			Computer networks may be classified by many criteria, including the transmission medium used to carry signals, bandwidth, communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network size, the topology, traffic control mechanisms, and organizational intent.
